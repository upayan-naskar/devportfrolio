# Developer portfolio

Hi, finally I have made my first develper portfolio.
It took me about one week to complete it.
But still there are a few things which are not completed :

  i) On the projects page the project link will not work as I have not ebtered the url.
  
  ii) This website is responsive only on mobile devices and laptops/desktops. It is irresponsive on tablets.
  
I will try to make out these as soon as possible.
